## @pgtyped/types
This package is for serializing PgTyped types to Postgres, and parsing Postgres raw text results to PgTyped types.

Right now the parsers are a replacement for the [pg-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg-types) package and as such 
compatible with the [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) library, using the `types` property of the 
[query configuration](https://node-postgres.com/features/queries#query-config-object).





This package is part of the pgtyped project.  
Refer to [README](https://github.com/adelsz/pgtyped) for details.
